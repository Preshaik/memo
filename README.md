Following the vote, FIRE received the highest number of submissions, with DCS coming in a very close second.


During the Lateral Kindness session at the November retreat, we had a thoughtful discussion about the meaning and tone of the names put forward. While FIRE resonated strongly with many, the group reflected on how the word fire can also carry unintended or negative associations — something we’re mindful of as an organization grounded in care, respect, and relationship-building.

With that in mind, and following further discussion, the decision was made to move forward with:

✨ DCS — Digital Client Stewardship ✨

This name reflects our shared commitment to strong client relationships, responsible data stewardship, and a connected, digital way of working across teams.
