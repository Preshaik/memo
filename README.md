Based on vendor estimates, the development effort for this solution is CAD 62,900. Importantly, this cost can be absorbed under the existing CRM service-level agreement (SLA) with no recurring licensing fees. Funding can be drawn from the remaining CRM budget within ILER (CAD 45,000), supplemented by available allocations from other support areas (e.g., Support Services or CS). To mitigate delivery risks, we propose adding 100 hours for data migration and 25 hours contingency, over and above the vendor’s initial 185-hour allocation.
With these additions, the revised estimated cost for this solution is approximately CAD 105,000.
Funding for this initiative can be drawn from:
	•	Remaining CRM Budget within ILER: CAD 45,000 confirmed.
	•	Supplementary Allocations: Balance to be covered by other support areas (e.g., Support Services or Corporate Services).

This approach ensures the project is fully funded without requiring new or unplanned budget approvals, while also providing sufficient contingency to safeguard against delivery risks.
To ensure adequate coverage for data migration and potential risks, we recommend allocating an additional 100 hours for data migration and 25 hours for contingency. This brings the revised total project cost to approximately CAD 105,000.
Deferring the implementation of the project management solution to a future fiscal year carries significant risks. Costs are likely to increase due to inflation, vendor rate changes, or evolving technical requirements. Delays would also prolong reliance on Teamwork, limiting CRM integration and creating inefficiencies in reporting and data consistency. In addition, postponement may lead to higher development effort if vendor resources or technical dependencies shift. Proceeding now positions FMB to capitalize on current vendor availability, avoid cost escalation, and prevent further system fragmentation.
While Asana was piloted across several departments, it did not prove to be a sustainable long-term solution. Feedback indicated that Asana is better suited for large-scale external implementations, whereas FMB’s needs focus on day-to-day project tracking, visibility, and collaboration across internal teams. As a result, many staff ended up using Asana as a personal task tracker rather than a shared collaboration tool, limiting its overall impact.

Importantly, the pilot reinforced—not diminished—the need for a centralized project management solution. The experience highlighted two key gaps: (1) the absence of integration with FMB’s CRM and workflows, and (2) the lack of adoption features tailored to FMB’s internal collaboration style. Addressing these gaps requires a purpose-built solution that is embedded within the CRM, provides transparency across projects, and supports both operational needs and executive oversight.

In short, the Asana pilot demonstrated that while off-the-shelf tools may fall short, there remains a clear and growing organizational need for a project management solution—one designed specifically to align with FMB’s processes, technology, and collaboration requirements.
While Asana was piloted across several departments, it did not prove to be a sustainable long-term solution. Feedback indicated that Asana is better suited for large-scale external implementations, whereas FMB’s needs focus on day-to-day project tracking, visibility, and collaboration across internal teams. As a result, many staff used Asana primarily as a personal task tracker rather than as a shared collaboration tool, which limited adoption and overall impact.

By contrast, staff using Teamwork expressed strong commitment to the platform and a preference to continue using it. They emphasized that its core features—such as project tracking, time tracking, file attachments, and dashboards—are essential for their daily workflows. However, they also recognized that integration with the new CRM would be critical for long-term efficiency and sustainability.

Importantly, the mixed experience with Teamwork and Asana highlights that the need for a centralized project management solution remains clear. The Asana pilot reinforced—not diminished—the demand for a robust tool by revealing two critical gaps: (1) the lack of integration with FMB’s CRM and workflows, and (2) insufficient adoption features aligned with how FMB teams collaborate internally.

To address this, the proposed CRM-based solution has been designed using Teamwork’s well-regarded functionalities as the baseline. These features were reviewed by Asana users, who confirmed that they would meet their basic project management needs, while also identifying opportunities for additional enhancements (e.g., color-coded task prioritization, shared calendars, and improved reporting). This ensures the new solution is both familiar enough to support current workflows and tailored enough to overcome the challenges that limited Asana’s success.

In short, while Asana was not a successful long-term pilot, the experience provided valuable insight into what FMB requires. The new CRM-integrated solution builds on proven Teamwork features, incorporates feedback from both user groups, and is positioned to deliver the visibility, collaboration, and scalability that Asana could not
