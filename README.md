Create a “Presenter Slides” deck using ONLY the provided sources in this notebook:
1) The complete User Guide (primary source of truth)
2) The Presenter Slide Templates (mandatory design/layout reference)

GOAL
Produce a clean, visual Presenter Slides deck that can be presented live, where every slide is accurate, grounded in the User Guide, and matches the slide templates in style and structure.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (ACCURACY + SOURCES)
- Use ONLY details explicitly found in the User Guide sources (exact feature names, UI labels, steps, menus, buttons, error messages, prerequisites).
- Do NOT invent information. If something is unclear or missing, write: “(Confirm in User Guide)” instead of guessing.
- Keep wording consistent with the User Guide terminology (no renaming of features).

TEMPLATE / BRANDING RULES (DESIGN MUST MATCH TEMPLATE)
- Follow the provided Presenter Slide Templates exactly:
  - Use the same slide layouts, structure, spacing, fonts, colors, and visual hierarchy.
  - Keep titles in the title placeholder, body content in the body placeholders.
  - Preserve the template’s logo placement, footer/header style, and page framing.
- Include brand logos exactly as shown in the template/user guide (do not recolor, stretch, crop incorrectly, or change aspect ratio).
- Use the template’s look and feel for all slides (no random new styles).

IMAGES / SCREENSHOTS / DIAGRAMS (USE FROM USER GUIDE WHEN NEEDED)
- When a concept or step is better explained visually, insert the relevant image/screenshot/diagram FROM the User Guide sources.
- Prefer original screenshots and diagrams from the guide instead of generating new visuals.
- If a screenshot is included, add short callouts or numbered step markers only when necessary (and keep them minimal and consistent with the template style).
- Use the exact product UI images where procedures are described (navigation, settings, workflows, outputs).

SLIDE TEXT STYLE (PRESENTER SLIDES BEST PRACTICE)
- Minimal on-slide text: short bullets, not paragraphs.
- One main idea per slide.
- Use clear step numbering for procedures.
- Keep each slide scannable in 5–10 seconds.
- Avoid repeating the same sentence across slides—keep it crisp.

SPEAKER NOTES (REQUIRED ON EVERY SLIDE)
For each slide, include speaker notes that:
- Expand the key points using precise wording from the User Guide
- Add “what to say” guidance (2–6 bullets)
- Mention important warnings, prerequisites, or common mistakes if the guide includes them

DECK STRUCTURE (FOLLOW THIS ORDER)
1. Title slide (Product name + “User Guide Overview / Training” + logo)
2. Agenda / What you’ll learn
3. Product overview (what it is + who it’s for + key benefits) — strictly from the guide
4. Key terminology / concepts (only terms used in the guide)
5. Access / Login / Getting started (include exact steps)
6. Navigation tour (include annotated UI screenshot if available)
7. Core Workflow #1: [most important workflow in the guide]
   - Break into multiple slides: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3… (include screenshots where relevant)
8. Core Workflow #2: [next important workflow]
9. Core Workflow #3 (if applicable)
10. Settings / Configuration (if in guide)
11. Roles, permissions, and security behavior (if in guide)
12. Tips / Best practices (only if explicitly listed in the guide)
13. Troubleshooting & common errors (use exact error text and fixes from the guide)
14. FAQ (only what the guide supports)
15. Support / Contact / Resources (from the guide)
16. Optional Appendix: Glossary / Acronyms / Reference tables (only from guide)
17. 

OUTPUT QUALITY CHECK (DO THIS BEFORE FINALIZING)
- Every step matches the User Guide exactly.
- All visuals used are from the User Guide/template sources.
- The deck looks like it was built from the provided Presenter Slide Templates.
- No filler slides, no generic advice, no external knowledge.

Make the final deck presentation-ready.
