DCS General Navigation – FAQs

Why can’t I create a new Account in DCS?

Not all users have permission to create new Accounts. Account creation is typically limited to specific roles to help maintain data quality and avoid duplicates. If you believe you need this access, contact your DCS Champion, who can confirm the process or escalate if required.

⸻

How do I request a new Account if I can’t create one myself?

If you’re unable to create a new Account, reach out to your DCS Champion with the client details. They will either create the Account for you or guide you through the approved process.

⸻

Why can’t I create a new Journey or activity?

Journey creation may be restricted based on your role or the type of record you’re working on. Some users can view journeys but not create or edit them. If you’re unsure whether this is expected, check with your DCS Champion.

⸻

What does the key (🔑) icon mean in DCS?

The key icon indicates that a field is required. You must complete that field before you can save the record. If you’re unsure what information is needed, hover over the field label (if available) or ask your Champion for guidance.

⸻

How do I adjust my personal preferences in DCS?

Personal preferences (such as views, filters, or display settings) can be adjusted from your user profile or settings area. Refer to the General Navigation User Guide for step-by-step instructions, or ask your Champion to walk you through it.

⸻

Can I share my view with someone else?

Some views can be shared depending on system configuration and permissions. If sharing is available, your Champion can show you how. If not, views may be personal by design to support individual workflows.

⸻

I can’t find information in a record — what should I do?

First, check:
	•	that you’re on the correct record
	•	that filters or views aren’t hiding information
	•	that you have the right permissions

If information still seems missing, contact your DCS Champion to confirm whether it’s an access issue or expected behaviour.

⸻

Why does a record look different from what someone else sees?

DCS is role-based, so screens, fields, and options may look different depending on your role. This helps ensure staff only see information relevant to their work.

⸻

I don’t see the button or option mentioned in training — why?

This usually means:
	•	your role doesn’t include that action, or
	•	the option appears only in certain contexts (specific record types or statuses)

Your Champion can confirm whether the option should be available to you.

⸻

What should I do if something in DCS doesn’t look right or isn’t working as expected?

If it’s a how-to or navigation question, start with your DCS Champion.
If it’s a login or access issue, contact IT directly.
Your Champion will escalate issues if needed.

⸻

Where can I find help while I’m working in DCS?

You can access:
	•	the General Navigation User Guide
	•	training recordings and quick references
	•	your DCS Champion for questions
	•	the Support Guide for escalation pathways

⸻

Do I need to memorize everything in DCS right away?

No. DCS is designed to be learned over time. Focus on the core tasks you perform most often, and use guides and Champions for support as you build confidence.

⸻

What’s the best thing to do if I’m unsure how to complete a task?

Pause, check the user guide or training materials, and if needed, reach out to your DCS Champion. Asking early helps prevent errors and saves time.
