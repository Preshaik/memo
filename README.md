Yes, that’s correct—we were initially looking to have Communications draft a message on behalf of the CEO to announce that the DCS is officially live and to reinforce its use, as well as highlight the availability of support and resources for staff.

That said, there’s been a slight update in direction. My Director and I are now exploring the option of working with Communications to see whether Scott might be able to record a short message announcing the DCS go-live instead. We feel this could be a strong and engaging way to reinforce the importance of the transition.

We’d really appreciate your guidance on whether this would be feasible and, if so, what the best next steps would be from a Communications perspective. If a written message is still recommended or needed alongside the recording, we’re open to that as well.

Thanks again for your support, and happy to discuss further if helpful.

Best regards,
