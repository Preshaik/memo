Create a “Presenter Slides” deck using ONLY the provided sources in this notebook:
1) The complete User Guide (primary source of truth)
2) The Presenter Slide Templates (mandatory design/layout reference)

GOAL
Produce a clean, visual Presenter Slides deck that can be presented live, where every slide is accurate, grounded in the User Guide, and matches the slide templates in style and structure.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (ACCURACY + SOURCES)
- Use ONLY details explicitly found in the User Guide sources (exact feature names, UI labels, steps, menus, buttons, error messages, prerequisites).
- Do NOT invent information. If something is unclear or missing, write: “(Confirm in User Guide)” instead of guessing.
- Keep wording consistent with the User Guide terminology (no renaming of features).

TEMPLATE / BRANDING RULES (DESIGN MUST MATCH TEMPLATE)
- Follow the provided Presenter Slide Templates exactly:
  - Use the same slide layouts, structure, spacing, fonts, colors, and visual hierarchy.
  - Keep titles in the title placeholder, body content in the body placeholders.
  - Preserve the template’s logo placement, footer/header style, and page framing.
- Include brand logos exactly as shown in the template/user guide (do not recolor, stretch, crop incorrectly, or change aspect ratio).
- Use the template’s look and feel for all slides (no random new styles).

IMAGES / SCREENSHOTS / DIAGRAMS (USE FROM USER GUIDE WHEN NEEDED)
- When a concept or step is better explained visually, insert the relevant image/screenshot/diagram FROM the User Guide sources.
- Prefer original screenshots and diagrams from the guide instead of generating new visuals.
- If a screenshot is included, add short callouts or numbered step markers only when necessary (and keep them minimal and consistent with the template style).
- Use the exact product UI images where procedures are described (navigation, settings, workflows, outputs).

SLIDE TEXT STYLE (PRESENTER SLIDES BEST PRACTICE)
- Minimal on-slide text: short bullets, not paragraphs.
- One main idea per slide.
- Use clear step numbering for procedures.
- Keep each slide scannable in 5–10 seconds.
- Avoid repeating the same sentence across slides—keep it crisp.

SPEAKER NOTES (REQUIRED ON EVERY SLIDE)
For each slide, include speaker notes that:
- Expand the key points using precise wording from the User Guide
- Add “what to say” guidance (2–6 bullets)
- Mention important warnings, prerequisites, or common mistakes if the guide includes them

DECK STRUCTURE (FOLLOW THIS ORDER)
1. Title slide (Product name + “User Guide Overview / Training” + logo)
2. Agenda / What you’ll learn
3. Product overview (what it is + who it’s for + key benefits) — strictly from the guide
4. Key terminology / concepts (only terms used in the guide)
5. Access / Login / Getting started (include exact steps)
6. Navigation tour (include annotated UI screenshot if available)
7. Core Workflow #1: [most important workflow in the guide]
   - Break into multiple slides: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3… (include screenshots where relevant)
8. Core Workflow #2: [next important workflow]
9. Core Workflow #3 (if applicable)
10. Settings / Configuration (if in guide)
11. Roles, permissions, and security behavior (if in guide)
12. Tips / Best practices (only if explicitly listed in the guide)
13. Troubleshooting & common errors (use exact error text and fixes from the guide)
14. FAQ (only what the guide supports)
15. Support / Contact / Resources (from the guide)
16. Optional Appendix: Glossary / Acronyms / Reference tables (only from guide)
17. 

OUTPUT QUALITY CHECK (DO THIS BEFORE FINALIZING)
- Every step matches the User Guide exactly.
- All visuals used are from the User Guide/template sources.
- The deck looks like it was built from the provided Presenter Slide Templates.
- No filler slides, no generic advice, no external knowledge.

Make the final deck presentation-ready.

DCS = Digital Client Stewardship
Go-Live: Feb 23, 2026 (update if needed)
Purpose: Help you get quick support in DCS and keep issues moving to the right people.


Subject: Preparing for DCS Cutover: Data Migration, What to Expect + What You Need to Do

Hello everyone,  

As we get closer to go-live, we’re entering one of the most important phases of the transition to DCS (Digital Client Stewardship): Data Migration and Cutover Preparation.

This message explains what data migration is, why it’s needed, what the cutover period means, and what staff can do now to prepare.

---

## What is data migration?
Data migration is the process of moving our existing CRM information (client records and key related information) from the current system into DCS. Migration ensures the information we rely on will be available in the new system so teams can continue their work without disruption.

---

## Why do we need to migrate data?
We migrate data so that:  
- important client history and context isn’t lost  
- staff can continue work in DCS without starting from scratch  
- teams can access needed information in one place  
- the transition from the old system to DCS is smooth and coordinated  

---

## What is the cutover period (and what happens during it)?
To complete the migration, we will have a planned cutover period beginning the week of February 16.

Cutover is the controlled transition window where we move from the old CRM to DCS. During this period:  
- the old CRM will be temporarily locked (staff will not be able to access it)  
- the project team will begin moving and validating data in preparation for go-live  
- we will use this window to ensure the right information is available and usable in DCS  

The goal is to complete the transition cleanly, so DCS is ready for use at go-live.

---

## What is data validation (and why does it matter before go-live)?
Before and during migration activities, the team performs data validation, which means verifying that data transferred into DCS is accurate, complete, and showing up correctly.  

Validation helps ensure:  
- key client records appear as expected  
- important details (names, contact information, notes) are retained  
- major gaps or errors are identified early and resolved before go-live  

---

## What you need to do now (light preparation before cutover)
Because the old system will be locked during cutover, staff who currently use the old CRM should begin light preparation now so you still have access to information you may need while the system is unavailable.

### 1) Create or confirm your client list  
- Identify the clients you actively work with  
- Make sure you have a clear list you can reference during the cutover window  

### 2) Ensure key interactions are captured  
Please ensure important interactions are documented in the current system, including:  
- meetings  
- calls  
- workshops  
- notes and outcomes  
- key next steps  

### 3) Gather essential contact details  
Confirm you have access to key details such as:  
- client names  
- email addresses  
- phone numbers  
- any critical notes you frequently rely on  

### 4) Flag anything critical  
If there is information you consider essential or high-risk, please flag it through your Champion so it can be reviewed as part of migration readiness.
