I’ve reviewed the proposal and proposed timeline submitted by the external consultant, and I just wanted to check in with you on a few items before I meet with Helen later today.

First, between now and next week (early November), she’d like to hold initial consultations with IT and Public Affairs to get an overview of our existing IT infrastructure and gather some high-level ideas. Would you be available to meet with her during this timeframe to provide that context, based on your current schedule?

Secondly, according to her timeline, implementation is planned to begin in January and wrap up around the week of March 9. Given that the CRM launch has been shifted to mid-February, does this period still work for the IT team to focus on developing the intranet integrations and supporting the implementation phase?

Related to that, would this be the right time to start looking for an external IT resource to support the implementation (Phase 2), or would you prefer we begin that process a bit earlier?

Lastly, I’ve also gone through the consultant’s résumé. I wasn’t sure if you’ve had the chance to review it yet, but I wanted to confirm whether her background and experience align with the specific areas where you anticipate needing additional support. This will help me clarify next steps when I follow up with Sarah and Helen.

Thank you, and I appreciate your guidance on this before I reconnect with them.
