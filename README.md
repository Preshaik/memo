1. Recommendation Summary

Following consultations with the Senior IT Manager and key stakeholders, this business case recommends that FMB proceed with:

Option 1: A customized SharePoint Online site as the official intranet landing page, integrated with Viva Engage for staff engagement and social interactions.

This approach:
	•	Leverages FMB’s existing Microsoft 365 environment, minimizing additional costs.
	•	Enables custom design and flexibility — the IT Manager has already developed a SharePoint mock-up that can be tailored with Communications and PA team input.
	•	Combines formal communication and policy management (SharePoint) with interactive social engagement (Viva Engage) for a balanced and modern intranet experience.

⸻

2. Executive Summary

To advance FMB’s corporate goal of leveraging improved information technology for better information sharing, collaboration, and project management, an intranet platform is required to centralize communication, enhance accessibility, and strengthen employee engagement.

After research and stakeholder consultations, two viable Microsoft-based solutions were identified:
	1.	Option 1: SharePoint site as the landing page (official intranet) + Viva Engage for social interaction.
	2.	Option 2: Viva Connections as the landing page (Teams-based intranet) + Viva Engage for social interaction.

Both options satisfy organizational needs; however, Option 1 (SharePoint + Viva Engage) offers:
	•	Greater customization and control for Communications and PA teams.
	•	Lower implementation complexity (the SharePoint mock-up already exists).
	•	Seamless integration with existing policies, workflows, and IT governance.

3. Background and Strategic Alignment

Current State
	•	FMB lacks a unified internal platform for communication and document access.
	•	Staff receive information through multiple disconnected channels (email, Teams, shared drives).
	•	The Communications team needs a reliable, centralized hub to share CEO updates, news, and organizational policies.
	•	Employees need an accessible and engaging platform to stay informed and connected.

Strategic Alignment

This initiative directly supports FMB’s corporate goal:

“To utilize FMB’s improving information technology to promote and allow better information sharing, collaboration, and project management.”

The proposed intranet will:
	•	Provide a centralized communication hub for leadership and staff.
	•	Support knowledge sharing and employee engagement across offices.
	•	Offer mobile-friendly, secure access within FMB’s Microsoft ecosystem.
