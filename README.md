Based on vendor estimates, the development effort for this solution is CAD 62,900. Importantly, this cost can be absorbed under the existing CRM service-level agreement (SLA) with no recurring licensing fees. Funding can be drawn from the remaining CRM budget within ILER (CAD 45,000), supplemented by available allocations from other support areas (e.g., Support Services or CS). To mitigate delivery risks, we propose adding 100 hours for data migration and 25 hours contingency, over and above the vendorâ€™s initial 185-hour allocation.
With these additions, the revised estimated cost for this solution is approximately CAD 105,000.
