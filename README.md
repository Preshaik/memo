I hope you’re both doing well.

Stephen has put together a draft design for our Envoke template, which we’ll use for CRM communications until the new name is officially announced (we can always refresh the design then). This means we’re ready to start sending out our updates.

Our next newsletter is scheduled for this Thursday and will include:

The names of the CRM change champions

The names of the UAT volunteers

A few additional project updates

Please see the attached draft and let me know if there’s anything you’d like to add or adjust in the newsletter.

I’m also thinking it would be helpful to send out at least one more piece of content before we break for the holidays, to keep momentum and build awareness ahead of launch. Some ideas include:

Short “why we’re changing” stories

Screenshots or snippets that show how the new CRM will solve real pain points

Highlights of key features we want to spotlight

Any fun facts or teaser content we can share

If you have any points you’d like included, suggested messages, or screenshots you’d like us to feature, please send them my way. I’m happy to develop the draft content and then share it back with you for review before we send it out via the Envoke template.

Thanks so much, and I look forward to your input.

Before I draft that message, I wanted to check in with both of you to gather any content you’d like included in this pre-holiday Envoke update.
Here are a few ideas I had, but please feel free to add or adjust based on what you think would be most valuable to highlight:

A brief “why we’re changing” message

Any key features or improvements in the new CRM that you’d like to spotlight

Short snippets or screenshots that show how the CRM addresses current pain points

Any fun facts, teaser content, or early insights we want to share

If there are specific points, messages, or themes you want featured, please send them my way. Even a few bullets or high-level ideas are fine—I can expand on them, draft the content, and then share it back with you for review before it goes out through Envoke.
