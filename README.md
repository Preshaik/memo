Hi Helen,

Further to our call, please find attached the Business Needs document. I’ve separated it into its own file so it’s easier to access and review.
Please let me know if there’s anything missing or if you’d like me to expand on any section.

I’ve also attached the Business Case, along with a link to the editable version should you wish to review or make revisions.
If you need anything else, just let me know.

Thank you.
