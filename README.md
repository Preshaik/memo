Based on vendor estimates, the development effort for this solution is CAD 62,900. Importantly, this cost can be absorbed under the existing CRM service-level agreement (SLA) with no recurring licensing fees. Funding can be drawn from the remaining CRM budget within ILER (CAD 45,000), supplemented by available allocations from other support areas (e.g., Support Services or CS). To mitigate delivery risks, we propose adding 100 hours for data migration and 25 hours contingency, over and above the vendor’s initial 185-hour allocation.
With these additions, the revised estimated cost for this solution is approximately CAD 105,000.
Funding for this initiative can be drawn from:
	•	Remaining CRM Budget within ILER: CAD 45,000 confirmed.
	•	Supplementary Allocations: Balance to be covered by other support areas (e.g., Support Services or Corporate Services).

This approach ensures the project is fully funded without requiring new or unplanned budget approvals, while also providing sufficient contingency to safeguard against delivery risks.
To ensure adequate coverage for data migration and potential risks, we recommend allocating an additional 100 hours for data migration and 25 hours for contingency. This brings the revised total project cost to approximately CAD 105,000.
Deferring the implementation of the project management solution to a future fiscal year carries significant risks. Costs are likely to increase due to inflation, vendor rate changes, or evolving technical requirements. Delays would also prolong reliance on Teamwork, limiting CRM integration and creating inefficiencies in reporting and data consistency. In addition, postponement may lead to higher development effort if vendor resources or technical dependencies shift. Proceeding now positions FMB to capitalize on current vendor availability, avoid cost escalation, and prevent further system fragmentation.
While Asana was piloted across several departments, it did not prove to be a sustainable long-term solution. Feedback indicated that Asana is better suited for large-scale external implementations, whereas FMB’s needs focus on day-to-day project tracking, visibility, and collaboration across internal teams. As a result, many staff ended up using Asana as a personal task tracker rather than a shared collaboration tool, limiting its overall impact.

Importantly, the pilot reinforced—not diminished—the need for a centralized project management solution. The experience highlighted two key gaps: (1) the absence of integration with FMB’s CRM and workflows, and (2) the lack of adoption features tailored to FMB’s internal collaboration style. Addressing these gaps requires a purpose-built solution that is embedded within the CRM, provides transparency across projects, and supports both operational needs and executive oversight.

In short, the Asana pilot demonstrated that while off-the-shelf tools may fall short, there remains a clear and growing organizational need for a project management solution—one designed specifically to align with FMB’s processes, technology, and collaboration requirements.

The communications team intends to use the intranet for several key purposes:

1. Centralized Communication:
- Share CEO messages and quick video updates
- Post press releases and social media alerts
- Provide easy access to organizational policies and documents

2. Knowledge Sharing:
- Share "tips and tricks" from the communications team
- Highlight style guide updates
- Provide quick organizational updates and achievements

3. Employee Engagement:
- Create a platform for informal staff interactions
- Allow quasi-personal sharing (like congratulations, fundraising efforts)
- Potentially replace or supplement the current staff newsletter

4. Accessibility:
- Make important information easily findable
- Integrate with existing Microsoft tools like Teams and SharePoint
- Provide a centralized location for organizational communication

The primary goals are to improve communication, increase staff engagement, and create a more accessible information-sharing platform. The team wants a solution that is user-friendly, can be used by leadership to set an example, and helps keep employees informed about organizational activities and updates.
In short, while Asana was not a successful long-term pilot, the experience provided valuable insight into what FMB requires. The new CRM-integrated solution builds on proven Teamwork features, incorporates feedback from both user groups, and is positioned to deliver the visibility, 
Our main goal is to deliver a project management tool that provides a simple, reliable framework for the FMS Support Services team and other departments that require project tracking. The current baseline solution (Phase 1) meets these essential needs by replacing Teamwork and ensuring a functional tool is available for day-to-day project management.

While several additional features have been suggested (e.g., Outlook integration, executive dashboards, enhanced security controls, and advanced tagging), these go beyond the initial framework and would increase budget and delivery timelines. We recommend that these enhancements be considered as part of a future Phase 2, once the core tool is in use and its effectiveness has been demonstrated.

At this stage, we ask for Scott’s guidance on which, if any, of these additional features are essential to include in Phase 1. This will allow us to confirm scope and budget with the vendor and ensure the solution aligns with both immediate priorities and long-term needs.

Key Takeaways for CEO
	•	Baseline solution = Teamwork replacement only.
	•	Additional functionality (Outlook integration, enhanced oversight dashboards, advanced PM tool features) will require new cost estimates.
	•	Decision: Approve as-is for Teamwork replacement OR expand scope (with budget impact).

	Confidence in Features vs. Leading PM Tools / Demo Availability
	•	Vendor Response: Solution mirrors Teamwork’s core functions; not designed to exceed features of leading PM tools (e.g., schedule boards, billing, advanced integrations).
	•	FMB Recommendation: Acceptable if focus is on replacing Teamwork. If CEO expects advanced capabilities, further vendor scoping required.
	•	Budget Impact: No additional cost unless expansion beyond Teamwork replacement is requested.
