Hi Helen,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to touch base ahead of our intranet project kick-off meeting today, just to provide some clarity around my availability and a few scheduling considerations.

I will be away starting December 10th and returning in January. I booked this time off last week, so unfortunately I won’t be available to support activities scheduled between the 8th and 18th of December. I noticed that Heather has tentatively placed a few tasks within that window, so I wanted to check whether there is anything you would like me to complete before the 10th—whether that’s helping to facilitate early meetings, reaching out to stakeholders, or setting things up to ensure continuity while I’m away. I’m happy to support in any way I can before my departure.

I also wanted to flag that the CRM team, particularly Iggy, is currently focused on data migration and other technical elements. Given how full his schedule is this month, he may not be able to participate in consultations with Heather in December. I’ve looked at his calendar and, to ensure we don’t overload him or compromise the quality of the work, I would recommend scheduling any technical consultations or access-related setup with him in January when the team is back and workload stabilizes. This is something we can also review together during the kick-off meeting and look at potential dates.

These were the items I hoped to discuss with you yesterday, but I thought it would be helpful to share them in writing ahead of today’s call.

Lastly, I’ve revised the business case to reflect the most up-to-date information. I will be sending the updated version to Sarah and Jacqueline for filing, and I’ll also email you a copy for reference. It would be great if Heather could receive the updated version as well.

Thank you so much, Helen. We can speak more during the meeting today, but I wanted to provide this context in advance.
