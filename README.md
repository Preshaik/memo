Based on vendor estimates, the development effort for this solution is CAD 62,900. Importantly, this cost can be absorbed under the existing CRM service-level agreement (SLA) with no recurring licensing fees. Funding can be drawn from the remaining CRM budget within ILER (CAD 45,000), supplemented by available allocations from other support areas (e.g., Support Services or CS). To mitigate delivery risks, we propose adding 100 hours for data migration and 25 hours contingency, over and above the vendor’s initial 185-hour allocation.
With these additions, the revised estimated cost for this solution is approximately CAD 105,000.
Funding for this initiative can be drawn from:
	•	Remaining CRM Budget within ILER: CAD 45,000 confirmed.
	•	Supplementary Allocations: Balance to be covered by other support areas (e.g., Support Services or Corporate Services).

This approach ensures the project is fully funded without requiring new or unplanned budget approvals, while also providing sufficient contingency to safeguard against delivery risks.
To ensure adequate coverage for data migration and potential risks, we recommend allocating an additional 100 hours for data migration and 25 hours for contingency. This brings the revised total project cost to approximately CAD 105,000.
Deferring the implementation of the project management solution to a future fiscal year carries significant risks. Costs are likely to increase due to inflation, vendor rate changes, or evolving technical requirements. Delays would also prolong reliance on Teamwork, limiting CRM integration and creating inefficiencies in reporting and data consistency. In addition, postponement may lead to higher development effort if vendor resources or technical dependencies shift. Proceeding now positions FMB to capitalize on current vendor availability, avoid cost escalation, and prevent further system fragmentation.
