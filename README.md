Create a “Presenter Slides” deck using ONLY the provided sources in this notebook:
1) The complete User Guide (primary source of truth)
2) The Presenter Slide Templates (mandatory design/layout reference)

GOAL
Produce a clean, visual Presenter Slides deck that can be presented live, where every slide is accurate, grounded in the User Guide, and matches the slide templates in style and structure.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (ACCURACY + SOURCES)
- Use ONLY details explicitly found in the User Guide sources (exact feature names, UI labels, steps, menus, buttons, error messages, prerequisites).
- Do NOT invent information. If something is unclear or missing, write: “(Confirm in User Guide)” instead of guessing.
- Keep wording consistent with the User Guide terminology (no renaming of features).

TEMPLATE / BRANDING RULES (DESIGN MUST MATCH TEMPLATE)
- Follow the provided Presenter Slide Templates exactly:
  - Use the same slide layouts, structure, spacing, fonts, colors, and visual hierarchy.
  - Keep titles in the title placeholder, body content in the body placeholders.
  - Preserve the template’s logo placement, footer/header style, and page framing.
- Include brand logos exactly as shown in the template/user guide (do not recolor, stretch, crop incorrectly, or change aspect ratio).
- Use the template’s look and feel for all slides (no random new styles).

IMAGES / SCREENSHOTS / DIAGRAMS (USE FROM USER GUIDE WHEN NEEDED)
- When a concept or step is better explained visually, insert the relevant image/screenshot/diagram FROM the User Guide sources.
- Prefer original screenshots and diagrams from the guide instead of generating new visuals.
- If a screenshot is included, add short callouts or numbered step markers only when necessary (and keep them minimal and consistent with the template style).
- Use the exact product UI images where procedures are described (navigation, settings, workflows, outputs).

SLIDE TEXT STYLE (PRESENTER SLIDES BEST PRACTICE)
- Minimal on-slide text: short bullets, not paragraphs.
- One main idea per slide.
- Use clear step numbering for procedures.
- Keep each slide scannable in 5–10 seconds.
- Avoid repeating the same sentence across slides—keep it crisp.

SPEAKER NOTES (REQUIRED ON EVERY SLIDE)
For each slide, include speaker notes that:
- Expand the key points using precise wording from the User Guide
- Add “what to say” guidance (2–6 bullets)
- Mention important warnings, prerequisites, or common mistakes if the guide includes them

DECK STRUCTURE (FOLLOW THIS ORDER)
1. Title slide (Product name + “User Guide Overview / Training” + logo)
2. Agenda / What you’ll learn
3. Product overview (what it is + who it’s for + key benefits) — strictly from the guide
4. Key terminology / concepts (only terms used in the guide)
5. Access / Login / Getting started (include exact steps)
6. Navigation tour (include annotated UI screenshot if available)
7. Core Workflow #1: [most important workflow in the guide]
   - Break into multiple slides: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3… (include screenshots where relevant)
8. Core Workflow #2: [next important workflow]
9. Core Workflow #3 (if applicable)
10. Settings / Configuration (if in guide)
11. Roles, permissions, and security behavior (if in guide)
12. Tips / Best practices (only if explicitly listed in the guide)
13. Troubleshooting & common errors (use exact error text and fixes from the guide)
14. FAQ (only what the guide supports)
15. Support / Contact / Resources (from the guide)
16. Optional Appendix: Glossary / Acronyms / Reference tables (only from guide)
17. 

OUTPUT QUALITY CHECK (DO THIS BEFORE FINALIZING)
- Every step matches the User Guide exactly.
- All visuals used are from the User Guide/template sources.
- The deck looks like it was built from the provided Presenter Slide Templates.
- No filler slides, no generic advice, no external knowledge.

Make the final deck presentation-ready.

DCS Support Guide (Quick Help + Who to Contact)

DCS = Digital Client Stewardship
Go-Live: Feb 23, 2026 (update if needed)

Hi everyone,

You’re invited to our DCS (Digital Client Stewardship) – General Navigation Training happening the week of February 9. This session is designed to help all DCS users feel confident navigating the system ahead of go-live.

Agenda (General Navigation)

Welcome + what to expect before go-live

How to access DCS and orient yourself (home area, main navigation)

Touring the main areas you’ll use most often (where to find key information)

Searching, filtering, and switching views

Basic record navigation (opening records, moving between tabs/sections)

Where to find training resources and support (Champions + Help Desk channel)

Q&A

📌 Recording: This session will be recorded and shared afterward for anyone who can’t attend live.

Thank you, and looking forward to seeing you there.
