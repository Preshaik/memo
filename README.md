 and am still working through the training videos.

By Monday next week, I’m hoping to begin meeting with the teams to better understand each business line’s perspective and how they use the CRM in their day-to-day work. I think it’s important to capture their viewpoints so I can develop more targeted training for each team, as well as FAQs tailored to their needs.

Regarding the general CRM overview, since we already covered this during the train-the-trainer session, I wanted to confirm whether we still plan to run a similar session for the champions. Alternatively, I was considering focusing on developing training materials for the general CRM overview instead.

Please let me know whether the preference is to hold general navigation overview sessions or to focus on more business-line-specific training sessions.
