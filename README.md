Subject: 🎄 You’re Invited! Join Us for Our Virtual Holiday Celebration – December 18th!

Hi everyone,

We’re excited to invite you to our upcoming Virtual Holiday Celebration taking place on Thursday, December 18, 2025! The holiday season is upon us, and we can’t wait to celebrate together as a team.

Please take a moment to confirm your attendance by responding to the invitation that was sent out earlier. The agenda is included in that message, and we have a fun, activity-packed program planned!

To help set the festive mood, we encourage everyone to join in wearing your favourite holiday attire—whether that’s a cheerful outfit, an ugly sweater, or anything that brings festive joy. We’ll also have a selection of holiday-themed Teams backgrounds available for you to use during the celebration.

And yes… we know many of you love a little friendly competition! There will be lots of games and exciting prizes to be won throughout the event. Come ready to participate and maybe take home a holiday surprise!

For staff who will be working from the office that day, we’ve got a special treat:
🎄 Pizza lunch
☕ Hot chocolate and festive snacks
🎶 Holiday music to set the mood

Come dressed in your festive best and enjoy a warm, cheerful time with colleagues before we head into the holiday break.

We look forward to celebrating with you!

Warm regards,
