Projects that staff work on, and being able to know how much time they're spending on different projects could be a big help. You know, it could be a big help to know, not even within like, the existing projects, but even delving more into like, how much time are we spending with each client, and how long does it take, you know, to go through the different journeys. So all of that, that piece could be really helpful. I know that sort of we're not quite sure about that one yet

Unknown 0:35
for the finance team, I think that would be the most useful piece of information.

Unknown 0:42
The other element that that I'm involved with is indirectly financed. But like, is that in this I don't know if you've already talked to Helen and Robert on, like, the PA side of like, what they need for the corporate Plan and Annual Report, okay?

Unknown 1:01
And for that one, we have like, a set, a set number of like, data points or KPIs that we would like to be able to pull out of the old CRM that can't, and it's a huge process. I can share that workbook with you that would be helpful, but it just shows like it's things like the number of First Nations with a foul, or the number of First Nations with a foul by province, or the number of clients working actively with the SMS Support Services team, like things, Things like that. And some of those aren't even in the new in the old CRM, and I'm anticipating that information we'll be able to capture in the new one.

Unknown 1:51
Yeah, things like, how many, how many active clients do we have, just in kind of any bucket?

Unknown 1:59
And this is, yeah, this is useful for the Annual Report corporate plan, but also, like when we're looking at budgeting and stuff as well, like to help kind of understand where our resources go. Okay,

Unknown 2:13
there's not a lot. Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned this, because Robert didn't really focus on this. I think he was really more interested in first nations leading the way, and also that in terms of events. And then he also,

Unknown 2:33
one second,

Unknown 2:38
yes, he was also concerned about testimonial tracking. He felt like that's something Helen might be interested in. And also he wanted to be able to get a meeting list for the external newsletter, to be able to just pull that out.

Unknown 2:52
But yeah, this is an additional I'll have a meeting with Vanna as well, so we can include this. I think the workbook will be necessary as well. So if you're thinking about how to create that form or create sort of a sheet in CRM, they kind of have a guide to help them, so be good.

Unknown 3:11
I'll send it to you now. I would say some of the stats in there are, like, HR stats, and I know we won't be able to get those from the new CRM, so you can ignore those one but there's the other tabs in there. Like, you know, there's one for CDI, there's one for SAC, there's one for ELR, and basically, twice a year, I send it to them, or Helen sends it to them and asks them to fill it out. And where they get their data up to this point has been very questionable,

Unknown 3:42
so it would be nice if and the report, and the other thing is, like the report doesn't have to look exactly like that.

Unknown 3:49
So there's no, there's no requirement that, like, the tables appear exactly as they are. We just needed, we just need those specific stats, and then Steven converts them into, like, nice charts and graphs for the corporate Plan and Annual Reports. I guess it's more, if they could just be summarized in in some way, or, yeah, I don't even know. Or if there's, maybe it doesn't even need to be a report, if this information is easy to find. Okay, yeah. Like that might be or, yeah, if we can do a section, pull out that information, and then we can create, add that to our spreadsheet separately, if that could work, yeah, I think it doesn't have to be exactly the way it is. Now, if there's as long as there's a way that we can pull this information at the point in time. So, yeah, that's the other thing. So when we report for the annual report, the stats that we put in are always like as at March 31 so we need a way for the CRM to have a like, you know, if I'm running the report in June, I need to know that this is the information of March 31 I don't know if that's possible.

Unknown 5:07
And same with the corporate plan. The corporate plan usually the stats are as of January 31 so we that's what we usually cut it off. So we need to say these are as at January 31 so we should be able to streamline too. Okay,

Unknown 5:29
that's good. Another thing that Robert said he was just thinking out loud, loud, but post event, he wants to be able to or rather, if it's not too much trouble to have the admins go in. So usually they have their data in a spreadsheet where they list out the number of attendees and nations that attended. And he was wondering if the admins could support after events to go into the CRM and just check, check off all the nations so, just so we have a tracking record or something like that. Is that something? Okay? So, yeah, I can't see why not? I think that sounds like something the admin team could support.

Unknown 6:18
Yeah, kind of like they're already doing with updating election dates and election information like that, kind of you know, administrative work makes sense,

Unknown 6:31
because he doesn't think Paris would be able to go in, and he just feels a bit duplicating that they have that data already they store separately, And vana said that's fine if they don't have that directly within the CR So, yeah,

Unknown 6:47
wonderful. Thank you. And you was going to be brief, yeah, I don't have too much. I know. Yeah, I

Unknown 6:55
can't, I can't think of anything else I don't like from your time on that the admin side. Was there anything that that you guys post from the CRM?

Unknown 7:05
No, it was really basically just supporting the ILR Loretta, updating elections and the new council members monthly. I know we're doing this monthly, but nothing would need to pull I'm just thinking, actually, the only other thing I can think of, and this isn't for me, but this is more for Scott, is and I've, I know this has been floating around in a few CRM conversations, is the goals,

Unknown 7:34
like, I think the ELR team or the CDI team had asked for all our corporate goals to be added

Unknown 7:43
to the CRM, so and then we have that project list outside of the CRM.

Unknown 7:53
I guess what is,

Unknown 7:56
until we know if the team works, things going to go ahead? I guess what are the what's the goals? How are the goals being put into the CRM, the new CRM, and how is that going to work for everybody, and not just like two business lines or one business line, like, are all the teams going to be able to track goals? I'm not really sure what that's going to look like I know that's one key thing for the SAC team. I'll go through the requirements, the stories again, but I know that that's something they wanted to be able to to be able to go in to see how everyone is going. I don't know if they sorry, because I'm not so familiar with the airline, but do they monitor the corporate goals entirely, or just for the sack team, because when I spoke to one, it seemed like they would need to just to check to see how each business line is going through their corporate goals.

Unknown 8:51
Yeah, I don't know. Like there's the goals are assigned. So there's corporate goals. I think there's like 30 of them, maybe, and each one is assigned to lead business line. So

Unknown 9:06
maybe that's what one was talking about, like, just the fact team one, but there's Yeah, so there's, but, if I'm not really seeing how it's how there's the cohesion, like, are some like, are we creating some kind of module, or not modules, but like, tables in the CRM for some goals, but not all goals. And should we consider how we're like, how we're building that comprehensively? Like, how are we thinking about this for FMB as a whole, versus just the silo approach that we had before, because that was an issue before. So if we're going to build some goals capability, let's not build it separately for each team. Let's make sure that we're aligning that, because that would be something I could see Scott wanting to run like on a regular basis if it's able to run progress against goals in some way. But I'm that's the one piece I'm not really I don't have a good sense of what's going on in the new CRM for that, but I've heard it being dropped mentioned in different places, like Shayla has told me she wants to be able to track her goals and link different things to the goals. So I don't know if they created something separate for ELR, and sounds like maybe SAC has something, yeah, because I know Ron mentioned that I can review the stories, and I can also just cross check with var again today to get a better understanding on that. Okay, yeah, what is it? What is it we're building for goals, and how is it going to serve the broader FMB, versus just, you know, a single business line. And then the other part of it is like, many of the goals won't, really, won't relate to CRM. Work like they're like IT projects. So what? What's the point of having that in the CRM? I guess,

Unknown 11:04
OLUWAKEYE, so I'm just taking notes.

Unknown 11:09
I know I had, I told you I would talk to Scott about but his if he had any specific reporting requirements as well. So I've got time with him this afternoon, so I'll make sure I raise that one with him today, and then if he wants to have a follow up conversation with you, I can suggest that too, but I'll gather what I can thank

Unknown 11:31
you, and I'll pass along to Vanna. I know we're trying to have that in the next the last spring planning session, so so we can include those. Okay, I'll get that to you today, then if I get any comments from him, okay, okay. Thank you very much, sir.

Unknown 11:49
And it's any kind of reporting in dashboards, yes,

Unknown 11:56
yeah, I'm guessing Scott will have something he wants, but I don't know that we couldn't do that with like, Power BI, right? Like, we'll still be able to build custom like, all the data is there, so if he has some specific needs, we might not be creating a like, a built in report today, but Jacob may be able to build him like his own dashboard and Power BI, okay, I know you said you wanted to reach out to grant as well, just to see if his team will be able to support with the Power BI and those kind of needs. If. Okay, yeah, yeah, I did. I did, and I talked to grant and Jeremy and Jacob is going to be the point person, and they're totally on boarding that, so they're happy to provide that. So yeah, I've got a lot of I saw Loretta asked that question earlier. I don't know if it was this week or last week, but I've been I've got that email flag to reply to, but if you're talking to them, you can let them know that grant agreed, and Jacob will support that. So we just have to reach out to Jacob when, when we're ready to kind of get him involved and let him know what we need. Okay? And I don't know if we also want to talk to Harold or you don't think he would have any, oh, about dashboard stuff, yeah, let me

Unknown 13:21
ask Scott that question.

Unknown 13:24
And if he,

Unknown 13:29
if he has any

Unknown 13:33
thoughts on what the board might need or what Harold might need. Okay, I can't think of anything like everything I think Harold asked for usually comes up in the context of, like, funding proposals, which probably would be covered by what Robert would have asked for, but, well, not events, because Robert didn't ask for events.

Unknown 13:58
Yeah, I think it's okay.

Unknown 14:01
Thank you. Yes, but yeah, I'll send you the stats the KPIs workbook, and then you have that for reference. But it doesn't have to look same Exactly. Yes, yeah. The point of the exercise is to get these data points in a format to give to Steven to build into the reports.

Unknown 14:20
Thank you so much.

Here's a draft email for Vananh:

Subject: CRM Data Tracking Meeting - Key Insights and Questions

Hi Vananh,

Following our recent CRM data tracking meeting with Sarah, I wanted to highlight several important points:

Data Tracking Needs:
1. Ability to track staff time spent on different projects and client interactions
2. Capture specific KPIs for corporate plan and annual report, including:
   - Number of First Nations with a foul
   - Number of First Nations with a foul by province
   - Number of active clients in different service areas

Reporting Requirements:
- Need to pull stats as of specific dates (March 31 for annual report, January 31 for corporate plan)
- Flexibility in report formatting is acceptable
- Possibility of creating a separate spreadsheet to extract required information

Key Questions Requiring Clarity:
1. How will corporate goals be integrated into the new CRM?
2. Will goal tracking be comprehensive across all FMB business lines or siloed?
3. What is the plan for tracking goals that may not directly relate to CRM work?

Additional Request:
Robert suggested having admins update post-event tracking by checking off nations attended in the CRM system.

Sarah will be following up with Scott about specific reporting needs and is open to using Power BI for custom dashboards.

Please review and let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,
Precious

1. How will corporate goals be integrated into the new CRM?
2. Will goal tracking be comprehensive across all FMB business lines?
