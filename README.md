I was thinking that during the all-staff meeting, before we move into the updates, we could run a short live poll to get a quick sense of where staff are at with the CRM. The poll would be anonymous and intended to help us better shape how we communicate, train, and support staff throughout the project.

The questions would be presented one at a time, allowing us to view the results live. This could also help the flow of the presentation, as some of the responses will naturally lead into topics we’re already planning to cover in the slides.

I’ve drafted a set of multiple-choice questions for the poll and would really appreciate your feedback — especially if there are any questions you think we should remove, adjust, or if there are additional response options we should consider including.

Let me know your thoughts when you have a moment. Thanks!
