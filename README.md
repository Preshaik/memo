4-Week Adoption Boost Plan

WEEK 1: Remove Friction + Create Urgency

1️⃣ Set a Clear Expectation

Send a simple message from leadership:

“All staff who use client information are expected to log into DCS by [date].”

Not aggressive. Just clear.

Adoption increases dramatically when expectations are explicit.

⸻

2️⃣ Give a “First 10-Minute Task”

People freeze when they don’t know where to start.

Send:

“Your 10-minute DCS starter checklist:
	•	Log in
	•	Open your business line view
	•	Review 3 client records
	•	Log 1 interaction”

Small, achievable tasks increase engagement.

⸻

3️⃣ Use Champions Proactively

Instead of waiting for questions:
	•	Champions send a 1-line Teams message:
“Have you logged into DCS yet? Happy to walk through it with you.”

Personal nudges outperform mass emails.

⸻

WEEK 2: Increase Visibility & Social Proof

4️⃣ Share Adoption Metrics

At All-Staff:

“We’re now at 62% login rate — thank you!”

People follow momentum.

⸻

5️⃣ Highlight Quick Wins

Share 2–3 real examples:
	•	“FMSSS logged 120 interactions this week”
	•	“IELR used DCS to track outreach planning”

Make it visible.

Adoption grows when people see usefulness.

⸻

WEEK 3: Make It Part of Daily Work

6️⃣ Replace Old Behaviours

If people are still:
	•	Using spreadsheets
	•	Tracking in Outlook only
	•	Sending email updates

Start gently reinforcing:

“Please log all client interactions in DCS.”

You must phase out old systems.

⸻

7️⃣ Add a Micro-Challenge

Example:

“Log at least one client interaction this week.”

Or

“Business line with highest login rate wins coffee.”

Gamification works surprisingly well.

⸻

WEEK 4: Reinforce & Refine

8️⃣ Ask for Feedback

Short poll:
	•	What’s working?
	•	What’s confusing?
	•	What would make this easier?

This increases psychological ownership.

⸻

9️⃣ Offer Focused Micro-Training

Instead of long sessions:
	•	15-minute “Power Tips”
	•	10-minute “How to log outreach properly”
	•	Business-line-specific refreshers

Keep it small.
