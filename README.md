I believe the Communications and Engagement Plan already provides a good level of detail regarding the types of communications we’ll be issuing and the roles responsible for each. I’m not sure whether Sarah has fully reviewed or approved it yet, but this is the approach we’re working with for now.

For the all-staff awareness emails, the plan currently states bi-weekly updates, though we can adjust this to monthly if preferred. I’ll be managing those communications. Stephen’s role is limited to helping with the Envoke template design—he won’t be sending out any communications. Once he grants you access, you’ll be able to prepare and send messages directly through Envoke as needed.

I can also connect with Stephen about setting up recipient lists to support more targeted outreach. For example, we can create a list specifically for CRM champions, and another for the client-facing departments who will be core CRM users. Envoke already contains departmental recipient lists, so that should be straightforward.

Not all communication will go through Envoke, as some updates may be better delivered through other channels. For example, executive updates may be shared by Sarah during SLT meetings or directly with Scott. Product owners may also choose to send their own communications outside of Envoke. However, for all-staff updates, I would recommend using Envoke for consistency.

I’ve attached the image here for reference. If you’d like me to break this down further or expand on any part of the plan, just let me know. I see you’re in a meeting now—feel free to let me know when you’re available for a call.
