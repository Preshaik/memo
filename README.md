Create a “Presenter Slides” deck using ONLY the provided sources in this notebook:
1) The complete User Guide (primary source of truth)
2) The Presenter Slide Templates (mandatory design/layout reference)

GOAL
Produce a clean, visual Presenter Slides deck that can be presented live, where every slide is accurate, grounded in the User Guide, and matches the slide templates in style and structure.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (ACCURACY + SOURCES)
- Use ONLY details explicitly found in the User Guide sources (exact feature names, UI labels, steps, menus, buttons, error messages, prerequisites).
- Do NOT invent information. If something is unclear or missing, write: “(Confirm in User Guide)” instead of guessing.
- Keep wording consistent with the User Guide terminology (no renaming of features).

TEMPLATE / BRANDING RULES (DESIGN MUST MATCH TEMPLATE)
- Follow the provided Presenter Slide Templates exactly:
  - Use the same slide layouts, structure, spacing, fonts, colors, and visual hierarchy.
  - Keep titles in the title placeholder, body content in the body placeholders.
  - Preserve the template’s logo placement, footer/header style, and page framing.
- Include brand logos exactly as shown in the template/user guide (do not recolor, stretch, crop incorrectly, or change aspect ratio).
- Use the template’s look and feel for all slides (no random new styles).

IMAGES / SCREENSHOTS / DIAGRAMS (USE FROM USER GUIDE WHEN NEEDED)
- When a concept or step is better explained visually, insert the relevant image/screenshot/diagram FROM the User Guide sources.
- Prefer original screenshots and diagrams from the guide instead of generating new visuals.
- If a screenshot is included, add short callouts or numbered step markers only when necessary (and keep them minimal and consistent with the template style).
- Use the exact product UI images where procedures are described (navigation, settings, workflows, outputs).

SLIDE TEXT STYLE (PRESENTER SLIDES BEST PRACTICE)
- Minimal on-slide text: short bullets, not paragraphs.
- One main idea per slide.
- Use clear step numbering for procedures.
- Keep each slide scannable in 5–10 seconds.
- Avoid repeating the same sentence across slides—keep it crisp.

SPEAKER NOTES (REQUIRED ON EVERY SLIDE)
For each slide, include speaker notes that:
- Expand the key points using precise wording from the User Guide
- Add “what to say” guidance (2–6 bullets)
- Mention important warnings, prerequisites, or common mistakes if the guide includes them

DECK STRUCTURE (FOLLOW THIS ORDER)
1. Title slide (Product name + “User Guide Overview / Training” + logo)
2. Agenda / What you’ll learn
3. Product overview (what it is + who it’s for + key benefits) — strictly from the guide
4. Key terminology / concepts (only terms used in the guide)
5. Access / Login / Getting started (include exact steps)
6. Navigation tour (include annotated UI screenshot if available)
7. Core Workflow #1: [most important workflow in the guide]
   - Break into multiple slides: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3… (include screenshots where relevant)
8. Core Workflow #2: [next important workflow]
9. Core Workflow #3 (if applicable)
10. Settings / Configuration (if in guide)
11. Roles, permissions, and security behavior (if in guide)
12. Tips / Best practices (only if explicitly listed in the guide)
13. Troubleshooting & common errors (use exact error text and fixes from the guide)
14. FAQ (only what the guide supports)
15. Support / Contact / Resources (from the guide)
16. Optional Appendix: Glossary / Acronyms / Reference tables (only from guide)
17. 

OUTPUT QUALITY CHECK (DO THIS BEFORE FINALIZING)
- Every step matches the User Guide exactly.
- All visuals used are from the User Guide/template sources.
- The deck looks like it was built from the provided Presenter Slide Templates.
- No filler slides, no generic advice, no external knowledge.

Make the final deck presentation-ready.


hope you’re both doing well.

I wanted to let you know that I’ve put together a draft General Navigation User Guide for DCS users. This is intended to cover the basics — how to move around the system, create and view records, create views, and manage a few key items — as a foundational guide for new and existing users.

Before I finalize and incorporate this content into the training slide deck I’m currently working on, I would really appreciate your review and input. In particular, I’d love your thoughts on:
	•	Anything important that may be missing
	•	Anything that may not be necessary at this stage
	•	Any areas we should expand, simplify, or adjust based on how teams actually use DCS

Your feedback will help ensure the guide and the training materials are practical, accurate, and aligned with user needs.

Once the training slides are completed, I’ll be sharing those with you as well for review.

Thank you so much in advance — I truly appreciate your guidance on this.
