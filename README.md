Robert,

I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to follow up to see if you’ve had a chance to connect with Helen and Kristin yet regarding integrating testimonial tracking into the new CRM.

In our last meeting, you had mentioned seeing value in tracking testimonials and also potentially using MarketingList for the external newsletter. If this is still something you’d like to see included, it would be great to confirm so we can plan accordingly.

Thank you, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
