Hi Sarah,

I just wanted to quickly clarify one point from my earlier email in case it wasn’t immediately clear.

To complete the full intranet build — particularly the technical configuration, hub-and-spoke architecture setup, and SharePoint Online development — we will need an external technical consultant in addition to Heather’s consultation and design support. The added technical components are outside of our current internal IT capacity.

Could you please advise if there are any available budget sources we can access to support bringing in this second consultant?

Thank you, and please let me know if further detail would be helpful.



I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to share a quick update after reviewing the revised proposal.

Following a detailed review, the IT team still feels there are some technical gaps that would need to be addressed for a complete intranet build—particularly around the technical configuration, the hub-and-spoke architecture setup, and some of the backend components required to implement the ideas we discussed.

Because of this, we are likely going to need to bring in an external technical consultant to work alongside HEDA’s consultation and design support. Iggy is currently looking into this so we can ensure we cover the full scope without overextending internal resources.

Given HEDA’s experience working with other IT support teams, we were wondering whether she has any recommendations for technical consultants she has partnered with in the past. It would be helpful to include her recommendations in the proposals we review as we look at the best option moving forward.

I also wanted to let you know that Iggy has looked at his upcoming schedule and he is extremely swamped in November and December. To avoid providing partial or rushed input—which could create issues later—he is proposing that any IT-related consultations or technical discussions with HEDA be scheduled for January, when he will be fully available to support the work properly.

In the meantime, we believe it would still be fine for HEDA to continue with the consultation, surveys, recommendations, and design activities, and we will coordinate the technical components once IT is able to engage more fully.

Please let me know your thoughts, and if it would be helpful, I’m happy to set up a quick meeting to walk through the proposed approach.
