How do I access DCS for the first time?

DCS is accessed through your work account. You will receive a link to DCS via Envoke and/or the DCS Training & Resources page. Use your regular work login credentials to sign in. No separate account creation is required.

What should I do if I can’t log in to DCS?

If you are unable to log in (for example, you receive an error message, cannot authenticate, or the system won’t load), this is considered an access or login issue. Please contact IT directly for assistance so it can be resolved as quickly as possible.

Who do I contact if I have access or permission issues?

For access or permission issues (such as not seeing the right screens, records, or features), contact IT.
For questions about how to use DCS or whether something is working as expected, start with your DCS Champion.

Can I access DCS remotely or offsite?

Yes. DCS can be accessed remotely as long as you have an internet connection and your work login credentials. The same security and access rules apply whether you are onsite or offsite.

Will my role determine what I can see or do in DCS?

Yes. DCS is role-based, which means what you can view or do in the system depends on your role and business line. This helps ensure staff only access information relevant to their work. If you believe your access does not match your role, contact IT to review your permissions.

DCS (Digital Client Stewardship) is our new client relationship management system. We are moving to DCS to improve how we manage client information, support collaboration across teams, increase data accuracy, and provide a more consistent and transparent way of working across the organization.

Is DCS replacing the old CRM completely?

Hello everyone,

### What this means

* This step is essential to ensure your client records, histories, and key information are accurate and ready for go-live.

### What you can do this week

* Use this time to **review training materials** and refresh your understanding of DCS navigation.
* Organize any **offline notes or client lists** you may want to reference once DCS is live.
* Reach out to your **DCS Champion** if you have questions about what to expect next.

We’ll continue to share updates as we move closer to launch. Thank you for your patience and cooperation as we complete this important step.
