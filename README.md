Thank you for engaging in today’s All-Staff meeting and for taking part in the CRM update and live discussion. We appreciated the questions, reflections, and participation — especially the feedback shared through the CRM word-cloud poll.

As shared during the session, your input has been invaluable in helping us shape how we prepare for CRM go-live. We wanted to follow up by summarizing the key themes we heard and how they’re being addressed as we move forward.

⸻

What We Heard

Your feedback was clear and consistent.

Top Concerns
	•	Training and the learning curve
	•	Change and adoption
	•	Accuracy and potential errors

Top Hopes
	•	Better collaboration across teams
	•	Improved efficiency
	•	A more user-friendly experience
	•	Greater transparency and data accuracy

These themes directly informed the approach outlined by the CRM project team during the presentation.

⸻

How This Is Being Addressed

1. Stronger Collaboration Across Teams
As highlighted today, the CRM is designed to support a more connected way of working by:
	•	providing a shared, real-time view of client information
	•	reducing duplicate data entry and fragmented tracking
	•	improving visibility into activities, updates, and handoffs across departments

This supports clearer coordination and a more seamless experience for both teams and clients.

⸻

2. A Practical, User-Friendly Experience
We also heard your questions around ease of use and training. To support a smooth transition:
	•	training will be role-based and focused on day-to-day work
	•	staff will have access to hands-on sandbox environments prior to go-live
	•	quick reference guides and short tip videos will be available through the CRM Training site
	•	department-specific demos will focus on real scenarios rather than one-size-fits-all sessions

Adoption is a process, and ongoing support will continue beyond go-live.

⸻

3. Transparency and Accuracy — One Source of Truth
The CRM will help strengthen data accuracy and trust by:
	•	consolidating client information into one centralized system
	•	reducing reliance on spreadsheets and duplicate records
	•	supporting standardized data entry and validation

This ensures teams are working from the same, up-to-date information.

⸻

What’s Next
	•	Additional demos and previews will continue
	•	Training details will be shared shortly
	•	Change Champions across departments will help support local questions and feedback
	•	CRM Go-Live is planned for end of January 2026

Thank you again for your engagement and for continuing to share your perspectives. Your feedback is shaping how we roll out the CRM and how we support staff through this change.

More updates to come.

Warm regards,
The CRM Project Team


Thank you for engaging in this week’s All-Staff meeting and for the thoughtful questions and discussion during the CRM update.

Your feedback from that session has continued to guide how we are preparing for CRM go-live, and we wanted to follow up with a written summary of what we heard and how it is being addressed.
