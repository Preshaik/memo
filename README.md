Hi Sarah,

I’ll be away on vacation starting tomorrow, so I wanted to ensure you have the most up-to-date information on the intranet project before I leave. We held our kickoff meeting last week, and Heather will begin her consultations this week through to the 18th. Helen and Chris are currently coordinating with Chandra to schedule time for Heather to meet with Scott, and Robert will also be speaking with Chandra to explore the possibility of allocating a few minutes at an upcoming SLT meeting for Heather to provide an overview of the project.

I’ve attached the revised business case along with the initial Business Requirements Document we prepared for the intranet project. These have already been shared with Helen, who will be forwarding them to Heather. They’re available here for your review as well, and please let me know if you would like them filed or passed along to Jacqueline.

I also wanted to flag that the initial scope of requirements may expand once Heather completes her consultations, as additional elements may arise—particularly from Scott or the SLT.

If you have any questions, please feel free to let me know.
