Thank you for pushing to keep momentum on the intranet work and for outlining how an external consultant could help us gather meaningful staff input to shape the new year. I share your goal of getting solid evidence and recommendations in place as early as possible.

At the same time, IT has flagged competing priorities through November–December. To keep everyone aligned—and to make sure we follow due process—I’d like to propose the following path that lets us prepare now without putting the teams under strain:

What we can do now (Nov–Dec):
	•	Finalize and route the Business Case for approval. This gives us the formal go-ahead and clarity on scope, budget, and phasing.
	•	Prepare procurement materials for the consultant (scope of work, evaluation criteria, timelines). This ensures we can move quickly once approved.
	•	Capture IT’s technical questions and assumptions (architecture, integrations, security/compliance, support model) so they’re reflected in the consultant’s scope.
	•	Hold our Monday working session to confirm objectives, draft the consultation approach at a high level, and agree on roles/availability through year-end.

When we engage the consultant:
	•	Stakeholder consultations would begin immediately after Business Case approval and completion of the procurement step (to ensure transparency and audit readiness).
	•	If timing lands late December, we can schedule the bulk of consultations for early January, with the consultant using December to complete desk research and discovery planning (no staff outreach yet) so that we still hit the ground running in the new year.

Why this helps:
	•	Respects IT and Communications resource constraints in Nov–Dec.
	•	Keeps momentum by advancing the Business Case and procurement in parallel.
	•	Ensures Sarah and Scott have visibility on how we are engaging the consultant and that we’ve met all approval requirements before staff-facing work begins.

Decision points for Monday’s meeting:
	1.	Confirm the problem statement, objectives, and success criteria for Phase 1.
	2.	Align on a draft Scope of Work for the consultant (what’s in/out, deliverables, timeline).
	3.	Identify named contacts and availability from Comms and IT for Nov–Dec preparation tasks.
	4.	Agree on a target timeline:
	•	Business Case finalized & submitted: week of Nov 10
	•	Procurement package ready: week of Nov 17
	•	Approvals window: late Nov–Dec
	•	Consultant kickoff (staff consultations): upon approval (late Dec or early Jan)

If this approach works for you, I’ll incorporate it into Monday’s agenda and share a short one-pager (objectives, scope highlights, timeline, and next steps) for review beforehand.

Thanks again for driving this—looking forward to aligning on Monday.

Thank you for continuing to drive momentum on the intranet work. I agree that having strong staff insights early will set us up well for the new year.

At the same time, IT has flagged competing priorities through November–December. To keep us aligned—and ensure we follow FMB’s procurement and approval processes—I propose the following approach that preserves momentum without overloading teams:

What we can do now (Nov–Dec):
	•	Finalize and route the Business Case to Sarah and Scott for review/approval, confirming scope, budget, and phasing.
	•	Advance procurement readiness for the consultant:
	•	Draft/refine the Scope of Work (SoW) and evaluation criteria (deliverables, approach to consultations, timelines).
	•	Complete a light market check and invite 2–3 comparative proposals/quotes (in line with FMB policy) to demonstrate due process and value-for-money before selection.
	•	Capture IT considerations (architecture, integrations, security/compliance, support model) so they’re baked into the SoW and any vendor Q&A.
	•	Keep our Monday working session to confirm objectives, align on the consultation approach at a high level, and agree on roles/availability through year-end.

When we engage the consultant:
	•	Staff-facing consultations begin after Business Case approval and completion of the comparative procurement step (to ensure transparency and audit readiness).
	•	If approvals land late December, the consultant can use December for desk research and discovery planning (no staff outreach) so that staff consultations start in early January without delay.

Monday’s decision points:
	1.	Confirm problem statement, objectives, success criteria (Phase 1).
	2.	Review and agree the draft SoW and evaluation criteria for the consultant (what’s in/out, deliverables, timeline).
	3.	Roles & availability: what IT support is needed for consultations and what Heather will cover from Communications.
	4.	Target milestones:
	•	Business Case submitted to Sarah/Scott: week of Nov 10
	•	Procurement package (SoW + criteria + vendor list) ready: week of Nov 17
	•	Comparative quotes & recommendation compiled: late Nov–Dec
	•	Consultant kickoff (staff consultations): upon approval (late Dec/early Jan)

If you’re comfortable with this plan, I’ll fold it into Monday’s agenda and circulate a one-pager (objectives, SoW highlights, procurement steps, and timeline) beforehand.

Thanks again for championing this. Looking forward to aligning on Monday.

the expectation is that, I think this has always been the case, is that it team has a technical or, like, has the support role in this project. It's never been an IT led project to, like, actually build and maintain the internet like we've always known that it will do the behind the scenes, but the responsibility for creating and maintaining it has been comms, or will be comms, because I think that's, you know, always been something that Iggy said, too, is like, Iggy, Iggy isn't going to be the one to maintain our SharePoint. Like, that's not fair. That's not an IT role. Like, yes, he can build architecture behind with some support, but it's a calm the responsibility for having a, you know, an effective internet is calm. So I think if they if they want to find a consultant to support that work, that's fine. If we need some additional technical support, then we either need to make sure that that person has that skills, or, you know, know that we have to source that as a second step, and then kind of reviewing, contributing to the the proposal that's been put forward, and offering any kind of thoughts on the proposal would be sort of where I think, like the IT team stands. I think it's, I think if we consider it a comms project from like, we've identified the technology now, like with the business case, and then now, if it's comms builds it, and it is playing that more supportive role. Now, does that help kind of frame it? Yes, okay, yeah, so I guess we need to understand what's going to be asked of us, right? Like, we need to know what is comms and what is the consultant going to need from it to be have and, like, what's the timing? Do we have the capacity and like, resources, and do we have the technical expertise to do that by the dates that they want.
