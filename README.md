🎉 And the New CRM Has a Name! 🎉

At our November All-Staff Retreat, we invited everyone to help name our new CRM system — and you delivered! Thank you to everyone who dropped a suggestion into the ballot box and helped shape this important part of the project.

After reviewing all the creative submissions, three standout names rose to the top:
	•	FIRE – First Nations Information, Relationships, and Engagement
	•	DCS – Digital Client Stewardship
	•	CIRI – Collaboration, Integrity, Responsiveness, and Innovation

Each of these names captured the spirit of what we’re building — a modern, connected system that supports our work with care, accountability, and purpose.

✨ The Big Reveal ✨
As announced at the January 15 All-Staff Meeting, we’re excited to officially share that the winning name for our new CRM is:

DCS — Digital Client Stewardship

This name reflects our commitment to strong client relationships, thoughtful data stewardship, and a more connected, digital way of working across teams.

And as promised, a small prize will be awarded to the person who submitted the winning name. 🎁
👏 Congratulations to [Name] for coming up with Digital Client Stewardship! Thank you for helping give our new system its identity.

👉 From here on, you’ll start seeing and hearing the name DCS more often.
We encourage everyone to begin referring to the CRM as DCS in conversations and communications — this will help build familiarity as we move closer to go-live.

You’ll be hearing more about DCS in upcoming updates as we continue preparing for launch. Thanks again to everyone who participated — this was a great example of collaboration in action.
